# Game Object Cloning using Prototype Pattern

## Overview

This project demonstrates the Prototype design pattern for cloning game objects, such as enemies and power-ups, with similar properties but different states. Using the Prototype pattern allows efficient creation of new instances without starting from scratch.

## Files

- **`GameObject.java`**: Prototype interface defining the `clone()` method.
- **`Enemy.java`**: Concrete prototype for enemies in the game.
- **`PowerUp.java`**: Concrete prototype for power-ups in the game.
- **`Main.java`**: Main class demonstrating cloning of game objects.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Compile the Java files.
4. Run the application to see the Prototype pattern . The program will demonstrate cloning of enemy and power-up objects, showing both original and cloned instances.
